> **"From Data to Action: An Open-Source AI Contribution to the G7"**

Resilience.OS is a jurisdiction-agnostic, AI-driven intelligence platform designed to operationalize climate data for public servants across G7 nations. By bridging the gap between raw telemetry and policy execution, it enables proactive, data-driven governance.

## 🌍 The Problem & Solution

### The Challenge
Climate change is borderless, yet government data remains siloed. Public servants struggle to translate complex environmental models into immediate, responsible actions due to a lack of interoperability and trust in "black box" AI.

### Our Solution
**Resilience.OS** is a **"Whole-of-Government"** platform that unifies diverse data streams—Agri-Food, Energy, and Supply Chain—into a standardized framework usable by any G7 nation.

* **Interoperable:** Seamlessly adapts to local data lakes and languages (e.g., Canada ↔ Germany).
* **Explainable:** Features a transparent "AI Reasoning Chain" to eliminate hallucinations.
* **Secure:** RAG architecture ensures data sovereignty; no data leaves the local infrastructure.

## 📸 Key Features

### 1. Unified Command Center
A centralized dashboard integrating real-time telemetry (via Tableau) with AI-driven insights. It provides a holistic view of climate risks across sectors like Agriculture and Supply Chain.

### 2. AI Strategic Briefing & Reasoning Chain
Unlike opaque black-box models, Resilience.OS employs a **Neuro-Symbolic architecture**. It visibly displays the logic behind every recommendation:
1.  **Data Observation**
2.  **Policy Lookup**
3.  **Inference**
4.  **Conclusion**

### 3. Mandatory Micro-Citations
To ensure accountability, every AI insight is strictly grounded in official government documents. The system cites specific pages of uploaded PDFs (NDCs, Legislation), ensuring full auditability.

### 4. Dynamic Policy Library
A "No-Code" knowledge base where governments can upload their unique regulatory frameworks (PDFs). The system instantly ingests these documents to customize its reasoning engine for the specific jurisdiction.
